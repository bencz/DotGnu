This file provides an introduction to hacking on the source code for pnetlib.
It describes what you need, where to go looking for useful things, coding
guidelines, and how to contribute your completed code.

Requirements
------------

- Automake 1.4 or later
- Autoconf 2.13 or later
- A recent version of Portable.NET's "pnet" package installed
- Cygwin environment (Windows only)

Obtaining a development version of pnetlib
------------------------------------------

The most up to date version of pnetlib is always the version in CVS on
savannah.gnu.org.  This is the preferred version to use to make changes.
To check out the sources via anonymous CVS, use the following commands:

    export CVS_RSH="ssh"
    cvs -z3 -d:ext:anoncvs@savannah.gnu.org:/cvsroot/dotgnu-pnet
            co pnetlib

If you already have a version checked out, then cd to your "pnetlib"
working directory and use the following command:

    cvs -z3 update -d

The "-d" is important.  You won't get newly created directories from the
repository if you omit it.

The most recent release version of the source is on the Portable.NET
Web site:

    http://www.southern-storm.com.au/portable_net.html

Building pnetlib
----------------

To build your pnetlib development version, use the following commands:

    cd pnetlib
    ./auto_gen.sh
    ./configure
    make

The "auto_gen.sh" script is only needed with the CVS version: it recreates
the automake and autoconf output files.  You typically only need it the
first time you have checked out the source tree, or if you have made a
substantial change to the configuration or build system.

If you didn't do a "make install" with Portable.NET's "pnet" package,
then you may need to configure as follows:

    ./configure --with-pnet="../pnet"

where "../pnet" is the path to the "pnet" source tree on your system.

Since version 0.4.8 of Portable.NET, its C# compiler is capable of
building "pnetlib" cleanly.  But if you want to compile it with
Microsoft's C# compiler, you can still do so if you have Cygwin
installed:

    ./configure --with-mstools --with-pnet="../pnet"

Even if you have a Windows machine, it may be best not to use Microsoft's
development tools.  Their SDK has a fairly restrictive EULA attached to it
which may make it difficult for us in the future.  Therefore, we want to
limit the number of people who have been exposed to the EULA.

Other things that you need
--------------------------

Now that you can build pnetlib, you will need some other information to
contribute to its development.  First, you need a copy of the ECMA
class specification:

	http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-335-xml.zip

Run the "All.xml" file within this zip archive through Portable.NET's
"csdoc2html" program to get a version that you can read in a regular
Web browser.

Second, you need to check out the pnetlib class status page at:

    http://www.dotgnu.org/pnetlib-status/

This provides a complete list of all of the ECMA classes, methods,
fields, and other definitions that we currently lack or which are
only partially complete.  This is a good place to start when looking
for code that you can contribute.

Class examples
--------------

The best place to start when building a class is to cut-and-paste a
similar class, remove the implementation, and then fill in the missing
details.  The following classes in the "System" namespace are good
examples of various class types:

    Random                         Classes
    Version                        Structs
    IComparable                    Interfaces
    DayOfWeek                      Regular enumerations
    AttributeTargets               Flag-based enumerations
    IndexOutOfRangeException       Exceptions
    AssemblyLoadEventHandler       Delegates
    CLSCompliantAttribute          Attributes

Previously, it was necessary to add new classes to the makefile structure.
Since the build system was moved to "csant", this is no longer necessary,
as new *.cs files will be picked up automatically.

Unit testing
------------

We are beginning to build a unit test framework for pnetlib.  The current
tests can be found in the "tests/System" sub-directory.  The framework
itself is implemented in the "csunit" sub-directory.

Unit testing is also another place where you can help if you don't want
to write classes in the main source tree.

Documentation
-------------

Currently there are no XML documentation comments embedded in the source
code.  This is for two reasons:

    The ECMA specification contains more than enough information
    for most classes, and users can easily convert the specification
    using "csdoc2html".  There isn't much point duplicating it.

    When a developer is writing a class from existing documentation,
    their mind is "tainted" to some extent.  If they created XML
    documentation as they wrote the code, it might unintentionally
    end up being a derived work of the original.  This may create
    legal problems for us further along.

Volunteers are sought to help document the classes by looking at the
pnetlib code rather than by looking at the existing documentation.  This
will help introduce some "clean rooming" to the process of documenting
the code.

Copyright
---------

All source files must contain the standard GPL header, together with the
name of the entity that you are assigning Copyright to.  You can choose
one of the following entities:

    Southern Storm Software, Pty Ltd
    Free Software Foundation
    FreeDevelopers.net

Be sure to check with your employer (especially their legal department)
to make sure that you have permission to re-assign Copyright.  Some
employers have conditions in their employment agreements that make all
work done by you belong to them even if you did it outside office hours.

For patches to existing classes, the guidelines are:

    If the change is less than 15 lines in length, then the patch is
    considered trivial and the Copyright stays with the current holder.

    For larger changes, you should either assign Copyright to the
    existing holder, or choose one of the above entities to assign
    joint ownership.

The following is an example Copyright header:

/*
 * Foo.cs - Implementation of the "System.Foo" class.
 *
 * Copyright (C) 2002  Southern Storm Software, Pty Ltd.
 *
 * Contributions from John Smith <john@smith.com>
 *

 * along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
 * Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 */

Joint ownership would look something like this:

 * Copyright (C) 2002  Southern Storm Software, Pty Ltd.
 * Copyright (C) 2002  Free Software Foundation

How to submit changes and bug reports
-------------------------------------

Changes should be submitted through the Patch Manager on Savannah:

    http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?group_id=353

Bug reports should be submitted through the Bug Tracking system
on Savannah:

	https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=dotgnu-pnet

Alternatively, you can e-mail patches and bug reports to Rhys Weatherley
(rweather@southern-storm.com.au).  The facilities on Savannah make it
easier to track issues.

When you submit a bug report, please provide the following information:

    - C# source for a test application that demonstrates the bug.
    - A description of why you think the behaviour is incorrect.
    - The platform (OS and CPU) upon which the problem was observed.
    - The versions of pnetlib and Portable.NET that you tested with.
    - Patch data for fixes, if applicable.

The preferred patch format is context diff's against the CVS repository.
Use "cvs diff -c filename" to create such diff's.  To create a context
diff for a new file that does not exist in the repository, use the
command "diff -c /dev/null filename" instead.

The "make_patch.sh" script can be used to assist in the process of building
patch files suitable for use with pnetlib.  The script assumes that you are
working with the CVS version of the source tree, not the .tar.gz version.
The simplest way to use the script is to cd to the top-level source directory
and type:

    ./make_patch.sh

The script will determine which files have changed, ask for you to enter
a description, and then construct the patch file.  The file will be called
"USER-DATE.patch" in the current directory unless you specify "-o":

    ./make_patch.sh -o filename

Normally the patch will be calculated for every file that you have changed.
To submit a patch for a specific set of files, specify them on the command
line:

    ./make_patch.sh ChangeLog runtime/System/Foo/Bar.cs

It is usually a good idea to do a "cvs update -d" prior to creating a
patch file using "make_patch.sh".

Please submit patches for:

    - Source files that were added or changed.
    - Resource files that contain new strings.
    - ChangeLog entries that describe the changes that were made.

To summarise, here are the steps for adding a new class to the library:

    - Create and test the new class file.
    - Modify ChangeLog to describe what you have changed.
    - Do a "cvs update -d" to get the latest version of the source.
    - Execute "make_patch.sh" to create a patch file with the changes:

            ./make_patch.sh
        or  ./make_patch.sh ChangeLog runtime/System/Foo/Bar.cs

    - Submit the patch through the Patch Manager on Savannah.

General coding guidelines
-------------------------

A. Avoid native methods where possible.  If it can be implemented
   in C#, then do so.  Efficiency will be tackled later.  At all times,
   be clear.  If you need to use tricky code, then comment it heavily
   to explain the reasons for the trickiness.

B. All strings that may be displayed to the user must be translatable
   using "_(tag)".  Add the default values to the text files within
   "resources/en_US".  All resource files must use the UTF-8 encoding.
   For example:

        C# code:

        public void name(Object value)
        {
            if(!(value is Int32))
            {
                throw new ArgumentException(_("Arg_MustBeInt32"));
            }
        }

        Resources:

        Arg_MustBeInt32=Object must be of type Int32

   If there is an existing message tag that expresses the error, then
   please use the existing tag rather than creating a new one.

C. If you are modifying someone else's code, then use their white space
   and brace-placement conventions, even if you don't like them.  That
   will prevent code degradation.  The default style in most classes
   is tab stops at 4 spaces, with braces on a new line.  Use "//"
   instead of "/*" for comments ("/*" used in Copyright headers is
   a special exception).  For example:

        if(condition)
        {
            // This is a comment.
            ...
        }
        else
        {
            ...
        }

D. Method and class names begin with upper case.  Field, parameter
   and local variable names begin with lower case.  Avoid Hungarian
   notations such as "m_" for members.

E. Use the names "Object", "String", and "Decimal" instead of the C#
   keywords "object", "string", and "decimal".  This keeps the naming
   system consistent.

F. Some classes need private helper methods and classes in their
   implementation.  Within "runtime", these helpers should be placed
   into the "System.Private" namespace.  The classes in this namespace
   must always be declared "internal".  In other libraries, create a
   sub-namespace called "Private".  e.g. "System.XML.Private".

G. One file, one class.  C# doesn't strictly require this, but it makes
   it a lot easier to locate classes within the source tree.
   For generic classes the filename has to be the classname followed by
   an underscore and the generic arity of the class.
   Example: System.IComparable<T> is in System/IComparable_1.cs

H. Namespaces are mapped to directories as follows: "A.B.C" is mapped
   to the directory "A/B/C".

I. If you have a method or class that is incomplete, then mark it with
   the "TODO" attribute as follows:

        [TODO]
        public void name()
        {
        }

   This attribute is recognized by the pnetlib class status page to
   report upon which classes and methods are incomplete.

J. There are classes in Microsoft's .NET Framework SDK that do not exist
   in the ECMA specification.  If you are implementing one of these classes,
   then it should be wrapped as follows:

        #if !ECMA_COMPAT

        public class Name
        {
            ...

        }; // class Name

        #endif // !ECMA_COMPAT

   Similar "#if" directives can be used inside a class when a method is
   not applicable to ECMA.

   The pnetlib build system creates two assemblies: "mscorlib.dll" and
   "mscorlib_ecma.dll".  The later only contains ECMA definitions.

K. Avoid RCS source tags like "Date" and "Log".  They tend to make the
   code look ugly, and are difficult to keep consistent when code is
   copied from one source repository to another.  Change information
   should instead be placed in the ChangeLog file:

        2002-01-07  John Smith  <john@smith.com>

                * runtime/System/Foo.cs: modify the "Foo" class to
                implement the "Parse" methods.

   This will acknowledge who did what to which file and when.  It is
   also easier to scan through the ChangeLog file when building the
   NEWS entry for each major release.
